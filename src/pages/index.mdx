  Every evolving, ever changing, and ever improving. I’ve been fortunate to be immersed in the rising tide of
  Jamstack,
  having led and built three enterprise level sites and an application with Gatsby. I’ve seen how freeing and
  flexible
  novel approaches to consuming data can produce solutions in new and exciting ways.

  Before getting ahead of where I am in my career today, how one has grown to where they are is just as important as
  what they’ve achieved. The challenges and struggles that I’ve overcome show why rising to the occasion and pushing
  beyond have kept me moving always upwards in my journey through development.

  ## How Postsecondary Changed Me

  My time at college was a rewarding experience as it helped prepare me for my future as a self-driven learner, and
  respecting the consequences of failure.

  ### What you’re not Taught, is the Lesson

  My first lesson at college came early from the disconnect from what the curriculum offers, verse what the world is
  evolving to use. In a field like web development, which changes on a dime, I got confused and questioned why some
  courses I was studying were with legacy languages. While I wholeheartedly believe understanding where modern
  languages
  come from, it shouldn’t be at the expense of essential modern learning. PHP was beginning its meteoric rise in the
  web
  space, and we were being forced to learn Pearl, and other similar learnings away from where the web was moving to.

  I began to realize that in the real world, no one is ever going to force you to learn what you knew you needed to
  know. You just have to teach yourself. That might seem cynical, but it’s quite the opposite, actually. I decided
  learning PHP was going to help place me in the field, so I took what teachings I could from my courses and apply
  it to
  the new tools myself. By the time I’d finished postsecondary, PHP had yet to be included in any of the course
  offerings. Yet, I had already built my graduation project in it, had a decent competency of it, and this helped me
  excel in the workplace.

  ### A Pivotal Lesson in Failure

  My biggest lesson during college, however, wasn’t that I should teach myself things, and it was a lesson borne
  from my
  biggest failure. Thinking I could finish and enter the workforce earlier going into my program nonstop, I did
  semesters back to back to back with no breaks. Classes went well my first three semesters until I failed out of my
  forth when the pressure caught up to me. Almost being put on academic probation, I pleading a strong case that I
  could
  prove I’d do better, if given a second chance. They accepted, and I immediately began a new semester and aced all
  my
  classes! Afterwards, I finally took a break before continuing again at a reasonable pace through till graduation.

  Had I not put myself through doing too much and failing, I may never of realized the resolve I can summon and
  foster.
  The experience helped transformed my view of what it meant to be and act professionally, and I attribute this
  event to
  my dedication to endeavor to perform my best. It also allows me to recognize that when others may make a mistake,
  even
  a substantial one, they can be the very best chances to learn and grow from.

  ## Learning the Ropes

  Tech: PHP, MySQL, ERP, JS, ASP, ASP.Net, Magento

  Skills & Services: Quality Assurance, Customer Support, Google Analytics

  I was fortunate to land my first position straight out of college at a fascinating product company in the gaming
  space, where I started, as many developers may, in QA. From this role, I got to learn how to break things, why
  things
  break, to understanding the reasons they get built a certain way to begin with, and the results of not building
  for
  resilience.

  ### Putting some Notches on the Training Belt

  Eagar to learn and start leveraging my tapping into development skills, they onboarded me to aid in developing a
  back
  office ERP system with PHP/MySQL. It gave me the opportunity to learn the ins and outs of inventory management and
  supply chain.

  There they came the opportunity to step into my first official Frontend development role in managing the company’s
  main website, marketing campaigns, emailers, and even some light ecommerce, all using ASP, and no, not the .Net
  framework, and even some Flash. Wild and crazy times when you’ve been in the field as long as I have. These were
  still
  valuable and prominent tools, and learning to develop good coding standards is never wasted.

  Parallel to these efforts, as I advanced in my role, I had the opportunity as well to support some Windows
  Application
  development in ASP.Net, helping to build a modern installer suite.

  ### Changing things up

  The websites served their needs until through a merger with a parent company; we shifted gears and transition into
  the
  Magento framework, and I could move back into PHP development.

  As mergers can go, however, not everything lands well for the smaller fish some times. As differences and
  struggles
  arose, preventing me from doing my best work, I sensed the need for a change. A door into a web agency opened up,
  and
  I continued my journey onward.

  ## Cementing my Foundation

  Tech: PHP, MySQL, JS, MVC CMS & ORM, jQuery, NodeJs, Less/Sass, WordPress, Bootstrap

  Skills & Services: GoDaddy, Linode, DigitialOcean, DNS Managment, Google Analytics, Git

  Entering my first agency position, I saw different take on web development moving away from product focused sales
  and
  tools. Supporting many diverse clients, all with specialized and nuanced needs through CMSs and other data layers,
  as
  a welcome change. Through these efforts, my skill and business sense was forged and solidified further.

  ### Why “done done” matters for UAT

  Early on, still have little experience working directly with clients where projects and requirements are driven
  primarily by them, I again came across a career defining failure. The first big project I produced was a complex
  Fintech website. Not having a well-rounded understanding of that field, and lacking guidelines and business
  requirements, I made some quick assumptions on presentation and UX while working fast, rather than smart. This
  cause
  features to have buggy result, and displaying poorly without perfect happy path use cases. As you can imagine,
  when I
  presented my updates before the winter holidays to the client, they were hoping to launch in the new year, and we
  were
  far from ready. Yet from another spectacular failure was a great lesson to be learned that working fast never wins
  out. While I was still acting professionally, the calibre of my work was lacking.

  I resolved to do my due diligence, validating requirements are clear before beginning, or pausing to gain clarity
  if
  blockers present themselves, finally triple check releases even when you think “things are good” to give clients
  the
  best possible results at all times. Least to say, while this specific client was immensely unhappy initially, they
  became quite fond of me. Through my dedication in supporting their services for my entire tenure at the firm, they
  were dearly saddened to see me move on.

  ### Laying brick after brick

  I helped to establish and mature the in-house CMS, crafted PHP and MySQL, which we improved upon for continuously
  with
  it serving us well. We found an avenue to transition to working with WordPress, but only after it was stabilized
  in
  years later.

  As with other early CMSs of the era, they were not always the most dependable in of themselves, and why our
  in-house
  solution continued to be maintained and improved. I worked routinely to set and improve code standards and
  patterns of
  using the system, improving aspects of the framework as new relevant libraries became available, around the JS
  layer
  with jQuery, extending to Less/Sass styling, and the importance of moving away from FTP to git management and
  version
  control on all things.

  Most developers nowadays take a lot of modern dev practices for granted, having not worked through and surpassed
  the
  legacy methods that many firms once used regularly. Seeing tools and tech to reduce risk, add stability, and
  improve
  our overall development workflows, I jumped at any chance I could to raise the bar on how we could operate more
  dependably.

  During my growth, I led projects and supported other developers through code reviews, began supporting the RPF
  process, defining estimations on projects/bids to quantify the efforts, and generating tasks needed to execute our
  solutions successfully.

  ### Looking to the Future

  After the advent release of Meteor JS, the future of the web being JavaScript was crystallized in my mind. The
  possibilities with real time delivery, hot reloading local dev, and socket connections blew my mind. I didn’t get
  the
  chance to fully leverage my growing JS capabilities through work at the time. Still, I began introducing better
  tooling and code generation to improve our development experience.

  We began seeking more managed services to help unburden the DevOps of running direct hosting and problems that
  could
  ensue. Also, the growing complexity and maintenance of the in-house CMS was becoming more apparent. Thankfully,
  with
  the improved stability around WordPress, it became attractive along with easier ways to run the CMS via SaaS
  provides.
  Transitioning towards this meant the team could focus more on doing good work and less time managing deployments.

  Because of my continued self-directed learning and growing competences, it once again opened the door for my
  advancement to another agency. They were seeking a talented JS developer in an early decoupled solution, and I was
  ready.

  ## Honing my Craft and Leading

  Tech: JS, CoffeeScript, NodeJs, MongoDB, Drupal, PHP, Sass, Material UI, React, Gatsby, Shell Scripting/CLIs

  Skills & Services: Pantheon, Platform.sh, Netlify, ASW Amplify, Jenkins, Bitbucket w/Pipelines, Github w/Actions

  In my recent firm of over 7 years, I solidified my skills in Frontend and the shifting JS ecosystem, cozied up
  with
  Agile project management, and elevated into the Frontend Lead.

  ### Node, the Crazy but Fun Wild West

  The early days of NPM were not for the faint of heart. While, arguably, it can be a source of frustration from
  time to
  time today, many newer developers don’t appreciate the monumental advancements and stability the ecosystem has
  evolved
  too. And decoupled solutions may be the norm today, yet these solutions were still up and coming a decade ago.

  Being Senior Development now, I took these challenges head on when jumping into things are full speed at my new
  agency. Eventually I found my stride on my first decoupled project supporting an ecommerce ticket purchasing
  system.
  We were leveraging Angular JS on the front and a NodeJs/MongoDB backend, integrating to a custom REST API which
  the
  client team was developing to manged accounts and order data, while finally tying in Stripe for payment handling.
  Phew! It was a giant leap forward from my PHP work. Moving from “take your time” cart based ecomm to expiring
  carts
  with finite quantities without back-orders, was quite a mountain to conquer. But of course, we prevailed in the
  end.

  Blessed with an incredibly talented and patient mentor who was a DevOps wizard, he helped me to improve and
  respect
  the importance of foundational data architecture. Knowing all the data points, how each layer and endpoint of the
  system communicates and validates that data so things can run smoothly was immensely enlightening. Without a CMS
  monolithic structure, we could do things with more dynamic data layering, and every piece of the pie could do
  something unique to support the overall solution.

  Following launching the project, the next would give us a spin on the fringes of the earlier days of Node
  frameworks.
  We had a project which began blending an early era static site generator to support a series of sites with a
  shared
  theme leveraging DocPad based in CoffeeScript/NodeJs, while connecting to a Drupal CMS backend. The aim was that
  content didn’t change that often, but at determined set intervals, and they had some concerns from previous
  experiences with CMSs being flakey at keeping their sites online. The team having a strong background in Drupal,
  foreign to me then, I realized really stood out with its integrations for this solution.

  CoffeeScript, well, that was a wild ride for sure! With its harsh opinionated syntax enforced, coupled with the
  complicated templating of DocPad, but hey at least we have arrow functions in JS now. We leveraged NodeJs to
  connect
  to Drupal, which fed data to DocPad and, through the data architecture, would dynamically generate components.
  Like
  the decoupled solution prior, we were doing headless CMS here before it was common practice. This too was before
  “componentize all the things” became the norm, so, it took some real magic to get the stars to align around these
  technologies. And just like modern static site builders, unsurprisingly build times and hiccups needed to be
  surpassed, finding a reasonably happy path. T sites could generate and build their specific content and themes,
  while
  shared components and assets across the sub-brands allowed for a more maintainable solution.

  ### Durpalizing the Componentizing

  Between the former project and those that came next, I was extremely fortunate to have a couple months of R&D
  focused
  research. It was the advent of the Web Component spec, and components were becoming more and more the norm as a
  way of
  development for more reusable frontend elements. Looking into tooling and how to generate components of different
  base
  types, naming and structure, as well as assisting some in how DevOps wise where we considered leverage Docker (up
  and
  coming at the time) into a new ecosystem for building our websites.

  As things progressed with later projects, I moved into the more traditional Drupal theming space, and pushed the
  boundaries into what it could do in the vein of componentization. Studying designs and similarities from pages to
  page, I recognized if things were just data, many UI elements are just the same component with unique styling or
  variations. It wasn’t too long before I helped define and build, with a talented partner, an internal component
  system
  for Drupal. It’s stood the test of time as its still being using successfully. Based on PatternLab and Atomic
  Design,
  it was born from Main Spring and an earlier iteration of Emulsify. We put own spin and standards to streamline
  what
  worked best for our team, added tooling, and a micro JS framework to pair component behaviours alongside Drupal.

  ### Stepping up to the TA Plate

  As things progressed, my aptitude for architecting and senses in breaking down components, aspects of good product
  design and UX, it was natural I transitioned into a Technical Architect role. Supporting developers while still
  primarily developing myself, I moving again to manage code reviews, helping define and flush out data and
  component
  architecture, and distilling these into technical tasks for the team beyond user stories.

  From this, I became involved once more in project planning and estimations from the RFP stage, albeit at a higher
  level than at my former firm. It was now my responsibility to formulate to the best of my ability with that
  research
  and known variables options and an ideal approach for solutions. At a high level, I had to know the scope of all
  the
  technical aspects and risks to help flesh out those elements for the bid. Advancing to this role, I became more
  prominent with clients. Helping deliver and clarify the technical proposals, I had to instil confidence in our
  understanding of their problems we’d planned to solve.

  ### The Shifting Frontend Landscape

  Before long, we would once again take a step forward in the JS space with newer approaches to websites. Through my
  continued expanding expertises in JS, it allowed me to advance to my role as the Frontend Development Lead. In
  this, I
  would take on the responsibility to help guide, lead, and mentor the frontend efforts across the company.

  Frontend has become to encompass so many elements now. Long gone are the days of just using a bit of HTML, CSS,
  and
  JavaScript on pages. Now we have Frontend UI components to design and craft, UX and State management flows to plan
  and
  implement, “Backend” Frontend through Integration or serverless to support interactions with APIs and resiliency,
  and
  DevOps with the growing complexity of CI/CD services and tools, the field has expanded incredibly in recent years,
  with no signs of slowing down either.

  As we moved into headless Jamstack space, we settled on the pair of Gatsby and React as our primary tools, as the
  possibilities of data from any conceivable source was astounding. From my exploration, however, I was admittedly
  learning we’d move us towards Vuejs 2.x, with its separation of concerns that I felt React lacked at the time…
  until
  React 16.8 dropped! With its functional components, hook architecture, and component level state (for when you
  shouldn’t be using heavier libraries), it was a game changer. It helped move us into a direction that the broader
  community has continued to embrace around React’s success and growth, and was clear that we made the right choice.

  It’s kind of funny that as JS classes in ES2015 release was a huge step forward, they lacked a finesse that
  frontend
  components required to be maintainable and readable patterns, coupled with the lack of shared state which React’s
  release ushered in.

  With a new and shine static site generator tool like Gatsby, old became new again, with reinvigorated the essence
  of
  why static sites were a critical concept that needed a comeback. Our first enterprise Gatsby site launched just
  before
  the pandemic, and proved the right choice. While our client’s competitors sites got hammered and run down from SSR
  traffic, out right breaking some of their services, our clients site was online and running without a blip. That’s
  the
  beauty of these solutions with having at most degradation of only isolated services when you build smartly in
  Jamstack. It gives end users a peace of mind while doing most of their needed operations nearly always.

  ### Leading a Team Successfully

  Continuing to respect the efforts in leading, I learned it takes more than assigning tickets or reviewing Pull
  Requests to mentor and inspire team members. Often project timelines and budget are limited, and while we always
  strive to do our very best, you also don’t have the luxury to take your time and build whatever you desire.
  Finding
  the balance of simplicity and maintainability instead is what I strive to lead the team towards, through
  constructive
  feedback and compassion so they know they’re safe to learn from their mistakes. I’m just a part of their journey
  through the field, and do everything within my power to guard them so they can stay focused and be productive. And
  of
  course, learning to challenging them so they can move deeper into the areas that interest them.

  A key lesson I’ve learned about fostering good Developers too is that they should not need to know everything. The
  better they can unpack knowledge and jump back into library/frameworks API docs when they know they need to use
  again,
  means they can always solve problems without a lead looking over their shoulder. I urge my team to keep a site
  like
  DevDocs pinned at all times to look up how to reuse methods and refresh core concepts as a healthy practice. And,
  not
  only to they write better code for it, they continue learning about extra flags/options or other tidbits they may
  have
  missed previously when they review it. This helps them to keep expanding their knowledge and improve. It’s truly a
  marvelous thing.

  ## That’s a wrap, for now.

  If you made it this far, I’m eternally grateful, and hope my path had some insights worthwhile. I could talk
  endlessly
  about topics around development from my journey, and where I hope to keep moving in the future, but everything
  must
  come to an end. So until next time, cheers!
